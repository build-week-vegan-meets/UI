### Git Set up
- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Add your project manager as collaborator on Github.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!).
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created <firstName-lastName> branch, committing changes regularly.
-[] Push commits: git push origin <firstName-lastName>.

### Follow these steps for completing your project.
- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge Branch into master (student's Repo).  Please don't merge your own pull request
- [ ] Add your project manager as a reviewer on the pull-request
- [ ] Your project manager will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master.

### Preprocessor Set up
- [ ] Verify that you have LESS installed correctly by running lessc -v in your terminal, if you don't get a version message back, reach out to your project manager for help.
- [ ] Open your terminal and navigate to your preprocessing project by using the cd command
- [ ] Once in your project's root folder, run the following command less-watch-compiler less css index.less
- [ ] Verify your compiler is working correctly by changing the background-color on the html selector to red in your index.less file.
- [ ] Once you see the red screen, you can delete that style and you're ready to start on the next task

### Features
- [ ] As a user, I can create and login to a new account
- [ ] As a user, I can add a restaurant that has vegan options (include address, phone, hours of operation, and menu (menu is optional on this step)
- [ ] As a user, I can view a page for each restaurant and I can rate it, and add an item (name, description, price) to the menu.
- [ ] As a user, I can search for a restaurant in more than one way (name, zip, city, price range, etc. (If you have a UX designer depend on him/her for this.)
